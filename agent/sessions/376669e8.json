While all the other fireflies blinked in a synchronized rhythm, Lumi's light flickered erratically, sometimes bright, sometimes dim, sometimes not at all. The other fireflies teased him, calling him \"Flicker-Fail\" and excluding him from their nightly light shows.\n\nOne night, a thick fog rolled into the meadow, blanketing everything in a heavy white curtain. The synchronized blinking of the other fireflies became a confusing blur, and they lost their way, bumping into each other and panicking.\n\nLumi, with his unpredictable flickering, was the only one who could see through the fog. His erratic light, instead of being a weakness, became a beacon, cutting through the swirling mist. He bravely led the other fireflies, one uncertain flicker at a time, back to the safety of their willow tree.\n\nFrom that night on, Lumi was no longer \"Flicker-Fail,\" but \"Lumi the Lightbringer.\" The other fireflies learned that being different wasn't a bad thing, and that even the most unexpected qualities could be strengths in disguise. And Lumi? He finally understood that his unique light was exactly what made him special.\n"
