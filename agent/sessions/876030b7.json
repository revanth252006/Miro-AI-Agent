Keep in mind this is a very simple example, and you'll likely want to expand upon it.\n\n**HTML (index.html):**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Pet Shop</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n\n    <header>\n        <h1>Welcome to Our Pet Shop!</h1>\n        <nav>\n            <ul>\n                <li><a href=\"#\">Home</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"#\">Cats</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"#\">Dogs</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"#\">Fish</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"#\">Contact</a></li>\n            </ul>\n        </nav>\n    </header>\n\n    <main>\n        <section class=\"featured-pets\">\n            <h2>Featured Pets</h2>\n            <div class=\"pet-grid\">\n                <div class=\"pet-card\">\n                    <img src=\"placeholder-cat.jpg\" alt=\"Cat\">\n                    <h3>Fluffy</h3>\n                    <p>A cuddly and playful cat looking for a loving home.</p>\n                    <button>Learn More</button>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"pet-card\">\n                    <img src=\"placeholder-dog.jpg\" alt=\"Dog\">\n                    <h3>Buddy</h3>\n                    <p>A loyal and energetic dog ready for adventures.</p>\n                    <button>Learn More</button>\n                </div>\n                </div>\n        </section>\n    </main>\n\n    <footer>\n        <p>&copy; 2026 Pet Shop</p>\n    </footer>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**CSS (style.css):**\n\n```css\nbody {\n    font-family: sans-serif;\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0;\n    background-color: #f4f4f4;\n    color: #333;\n}\n\nheader {\n    background-color: #333;\n    color: #fff;\n    padding: 1em 0;\n    text-align: center;\n}\n\nheader nav ul {\n    padding: 0;\n    list-style: none;\n}\n\nheader nav ul li {\n    display: inline;\n    margin: 0 1em;\n}\n\nheader nav ul li a {\n    color: #fff;\n    text-decoration: none;\n}\n\nmain {\n    padding: 20px;\n}\n\n.featured-pets {\n    background-color: #fff;\n    padding: 20px;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n}\n\n.pet-grid {\n    display: flex;\n    justify-content: space-around;\n}\n\n.pet-card {\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n    padding: 10px;\n    margin-bottom: 20px;\n    text-align: center;\n    width: 300px;\n}\n\n.pet-card img {\n    width: 100%;\n    height: auto;\n}\n\nfooter {\n    background-color: #333;\n    color: #fff;\n    text-align: center;\n    padding: 1em 0;\n    position: fixed;\n    bottom: 0;\n    width: 100%;\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation and How to Use:**\n\n1.  **Save the files:**\n    *   Create a new folder for your pet shop project.\n    *   Save the HTML code as `index.html` in that folder.\n    *   Save the CSS code as `style.css` in the same folder.\n    *   Download some placeholder images (like a cat and a dog) and save them as `placeholder-cat.jpg` and `placeholder-dog.jpg` in the same folder.  You can find free images on sites like Unsplash or Pexels.\n2.  **Open in your browser:**  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).\n\n**Key Improvements and Next Steps:**\n\n*   **Replace Placeholder Images:**  The most important thing is to replace the `placeholder-cat.jpg` and `placeholder-dog.jpg` with actual images of pets you want to feature.\n*   **More Pets:**  Add more `pet-card` divs inside the `pet-grid` to display more pets.\n*   **Navigation:**  Make the navigation links in the `<nav>` section actually link to other pages on your website (e.g., `cats.html`, `dogs.html`).\n*   **Responsiveness:**  Use CSS media queries to make the layout responsive so it looks good on different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, phones).  This is crucial for modern websites.\n*   **More Detailed CSS:**  Add more CSS to style the elements to your liking.  You can change colors, fonts, spacing, etc.\n*   **JavaScript:**  If you want to add interactive features (e.g., a shopping cart, image galleries), you'll need to use JavaScript.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to elaborate on any of these points!\n"
