Here's a breakdown of their key features:\n\n| Feature             | OnePlus Nord CE4                                     | iPhone 15                                                    |\n| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Price Segment**   | Mid-range                                            | Premium / Flagship                                           |\n| **Operating System**| Android (OxygenOS)                                   | iOS                                                          |\n| **Processor**       | Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 3                          | Apple A16 Bionic                                             |\n| **Display**         | 6.7-inch Fluid AMOLED, 120Hz refresh rate, HDR10+    | 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED, 60Hz refresh rate, HDR       |\n| **Main Camera**     | 50MP Sony LYT-600 (OIS)                              | 48MP (OIS, Sensor-shift OIS)                                 |\n| **Ultrawide Camera**| 8MP Sony IMX355                                      | 12MP                                                         |\n| **Front Camera**    | 16MP                                                 | 12MP (Autofocus)                                             |\n| **Battery**         | 5500 mAh                                             | ~3349 mAh (typical)                                          |\n| **Charging**        | 100W SUPERVOOC Fast Charging (wired)                 | 20W Fast Charging (wired), MagSafe Wireless, Qi2 Wireless    |\n| **Build Materials** | Plastic frame, Plastic back                          | Aluminum frame, Color-infused glass back, Ceramic Shield front |\n| **Durability**      | IP54 dust and splash resistance                      | IP68 dust and water resistance                               |\n| **Security**        | In-display Fingerprint Sensor, Face Unlock           | Face ID                                                      |\n| **Connectivity**    | 5G, Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.4                           | 5G, Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, UWB (2nd gen)                    |\n| **Unique Features** | Aqua Touch display, IR Blaster                       | Dynamic Island, Satellite SOS, Crash Detection, USB-C        |\n\n**Key Differences and Considerations:**\n\n1.  **Price & Value:** The OnePlus Nord CE4 is significantly more affordable, offering excellent value for its price, especially with its fast charging and display. The iPhone 15 is a premium device with a higher price tag.\n2.  **Operating System:** This is a fundamental choice. Android (OxygenOS) on the Nord CE4 offers more customization and openness, while iOS on the iPhone 15 is known for its simplicity, security, and tight ecosystem integration.\n3.  **Performance:** The Apple A16 Bionic chip in the iPhone 15 is considerably more powerful than the Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 in the Nord CE4. The iPhone 15 will offer superior performance for demanding games, video editing, and overall smoothness, with better longevity in terms of sustained performance.\n4.  **Camera System:** While both have good cameras, the iPhone 15 generally delivers superior image processing, consistency, low-light performance, and video quality, making it the better choice for photography and videography enthusiasts. The Nord CE4's camera is competent for its price segment.\n5.  **Charging Speed:** The Nord CE4 boasts incredibly fast 100W wired charging, which can fully charge the phone in a very short time. The iPhone 15's charging is much slower by comparison, though it offers wireless charging options.\n6.  **Build Quality & Durability:** The iPhone 15 uses more premium materials (aluminum, glass, Ceramic Shield) and has a higher IP rating for water and dust resistance, giving it a more premium feel and better protection against elements.\n7.  **Display:** The Nord CE4 has a larger display with a higher 120Hz refresh rate, making scrolling and animations much smoother. The iPhone 15's display is smaller with a standard 60Hz refresh rate, but it offers excellent color accuracy and brightness.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n*   Choose the **OnePlus Nord CE4** if you prioritize **affordability, super-fast charging, a smooth 120Hz display, Android customization, and strong mid-range performance.**\n*   Choose the **iPhone 15** if you prioritize **top-tier performance, a superior camera system (especially for video), the iOS ecosystem, premium build quality, long-term software support, and a more compact form factor.**"
