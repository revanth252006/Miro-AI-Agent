What are you trying to achieve with data mining?\n*   **Questions:** What business questions need answering? What are the project goals?  What data is relevant?\n*   **Output:** Clear project objectives and requirements.\n\n**2. Data Understanding:**\n\n*   **Goal:**  Gather, explore, and understand the data.\n*   **Actions:** Collect initial data, describe data (format, quantity, fields), explore data (statistical analysis, visualization), verify data quality (missing values, errors).\n*   **Output:** Data description report, data quality assessment.\n\n**3. Data Preparation:**\n\n*   **Goal:** Clean, transform, and prepare the data for modeling.\n*   **Actions:** Data cleaning (handle missing values, remove noise), data transformation (normalize, aggregate), data integration (combine data from multiple sources), data reduction (reduce dimensionality).\n*   **Output:** Cleaned and transformed dataset.\n\n**4. Modeling:**\n\n*   **Goal:** Select and apply appropriate data mining techniques.\n*   **Actions:** Choose modeling techniques (classification, regression, clustering, association rule mining, etc.), generate test design, build and assess models.\n*   **Output:** Trained models.\n\n**5. Evaluation:**\n\n*   **Goal:** Evaluate the models and interpret the results in the context of the business objectives.\n*   **Actions:** Evaluate models based on chosen metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.), interpret the results, compare models, identify potentially useful patterns.\n*   **Output:** Evaluated models and insights.\n\n**6. Deployment:**\n\n*   **Goal:** Deploy the model and integrate it into the business processes.\n*   **Actions:** Plan deployment, plan monitoring and maintenance, produce final report, review project.\n*   **Output:** Deployed model, monitoring plan, final report.\n\nEssentially, it's an iterative process, and you often go back and refine earlier steps based on what you learn later in the process.
