          "text": "That's a great question! As a Miro Agent, my purpose is to provide helpful, accurate, and insightful assistance, particularly within the context of Miro and general knowledge. Google Gemini, being a state-of-the-art general-purpose AI model developed by Google, has a broader range of functionalities.\n\nHere are some key features that Google Gemini possesses which I, as a text-based AI assistant, generally do not:\n\n1.  **True Multimodality:** Gemini is designed to understand and operate across various modalities simultaneously, including text, images, audio, and video. It can \"see\" images, \"hear\" audio, and process video content directly. As a text-based AI, I primarily process and generate text. I can describe or discuss visual and audio concepts, but I don't inherently \"perceive\" them in the same way.\n2.  **Real-time Web Access and Search Integration:** Gemini, especially when integrated with Google Search, can access and synthesize information from the live web in real-time, providing up-to-the-minute details on current events, research, and trends. My knowledge base has a cut-off date and is not continuously updated from the live internet.\n3.  **Direct Image Generation:** Gemini can integrate with advanced diffusion models to generate novel images directly from text prompts. I can describe what an image might look like, but I cannot create the visual content myself.\n4.  **Deep Integration with Google's Ecosystem:** Gemini is deeply integrated with Google's vast suite of products and services, such as Google Workspace, YouTube, Google Maps, allowing for seamless interaction within that ecosystem. My primary focus and integration are tailored to Miro and general knowledge tasks.\n5.  **Advanced Code Generation and Execution:** While I can discuss programming concepts and provide explanations, Gemini demonstrates more sophisticated capabilities in generating, debugging, and explaining complex code, and can sometimes execute code internally for verification.\n6.  **More Advanced Agentic Capabilities:** Gemini is being developed with more sophisticated \"agentic\" capabilities to plan and execute complex multi-step tasks across different tools and environments autonomously. My role is more focused on direct conversational assistance and information retrieval based on prompts.\n\nMy strengths lie in providing clear, accurate, and helpful responses within my domain of knowledge, which includes assisting with Miro-related inquiries and a broad range of general topics."
