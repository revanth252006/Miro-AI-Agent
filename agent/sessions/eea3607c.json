Compared to Google Gemini, here are some features I might not have:\n\n*   **Broad General Knowledge:** Gemini has access to a vast amount of information across diverse topics. My knowledge base is more tailored toward collaboration, productivity, and Miro-specific functionalities.\n*   **Real-time Information Updates:** Gemini can provide real-time updates on news, weather, and other dynamic information. My focus is on static knowledge and processes.\n*   **Advanced Language Translation:** While I can assist with basic language tasks, Gemini likely has more sophisticated language translation capabilities.\n*   **Integration with the broader Google ecosystem:** Gemini seamlessly integrates with Google's suite of applications. My integrations are more focused on tools relevant to visual collaboration and project management.\n*   **Creative Content Generation:** Gemini can generate various creative content formats, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc. I'm more geared towards practical task completion and information retrieval.\n\nEssentially, Gemini is a general-purpose AI, while I am specialized for Miro and collaborative workflows.\n"
