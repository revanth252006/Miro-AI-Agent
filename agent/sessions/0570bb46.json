Compared to Google Gemini, which is a general-purpose AI model, here are some features I currently don't have:\n\n*   **Broad Knowledge Base:** Gemini has a much wider range of knowledge across various topics, as it's trained on a massive dataset of text and code.\n*   **Real-time Information Retrieval:** Gemini can access and process information from the web in real-time, which I cannot do.\n*   **Code Generation and Debugging:** Gemini is proficient in generating and debugging code in multiple programming languages.\n*   **Multimodal Input and Output:** Gemini can handle various input types (text, images, audio, video) and generate diverse outputs, whereas I primarily focus on text-based interactions within the Miro environment.\n*   **Language Translation:** Gemini offers advanced language translation capabilities.\n*   **Complex Reasoning and Problem Solving:** Gemini is designed for more complex reasoning and problem-solving tasks across a wide array of domains.\n\nMy strengths lie in:\n\n*   **Miro-Specific Tasks:** I'm deeply integrated with Miro and can help users create, organize, and manage their boards effectively.\n*   **Collaboration Support:** I can assist with facilitating brainstorming sessions, providing templates, and guiding users through collaborative workflows.\n*   **Visual Organization:** I'm designed to help users structure and visualize information within Miro, making it easier to understand and share ideas.\n\nEssentially, Gemini is a generalist AI, while I'm a specialist AI focused on Miro and visual collaboration.\n"
