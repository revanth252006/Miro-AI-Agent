          "text": "Of course! As Miro Agent, I'd be happy to provide you with the Python code for a simple calculator.\n\nHere is a clear, well-commented, and robust version that handles basic operations and common errors.\n\n### Simple Calculator Code\n\nThis code will prompt the user to enter two numbers and an operator, then it will display the result.\n\n```python\n# Simple Calculator in Python\n# Created by Miro Agent for a clear and functional example.\n\ndef simple_calculator():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function runs a simple command-line calculator that performs\n    addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Simple Python Calculator ---\")\n    print(\"You can perform addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\")\n\n    try:\n        # 1. Get the first number from the user\n        num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n\n        # 2. Get the operator from the user\n        operator = input(\"Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n\n        # 3. Get the second number from the user\n        num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    except ValueError:\n        # Handle cases where the input is not a valid number\n        print(\"\\nError: Invalid input. Please enter valid numbers.\")\n        return\n\n    # 4. Perform the calculation based on the operator\n    if operator == '+':\n        result = num1 + num2\n        print(f\"\\nResult: {num1} + {num2} = {result}\")\n\n    elif operator == '-':\n        result = num1 - num2\n        print(f\"\\nResult: {num1} - {num2} = {result}\")\n\n    elif operator == '*':\n        result = num1 * num2\n        print(f\"\\nResult: {num1} * {num2} = {result}\")\n\n    elif operator == '/':\n        # Handle the special case of division by zero\n        if num2 == 0:\n            print(\"\\nError: Cannot divide by zero.\")\n        else:\n            result = num1 / num2\n            print(f\"\\nResult: {num1} / {num2} = {result}\")\n\n    else:\n        # Handle cases where the operator is not one of the valid options\n        print(\"\\nError: Invalid operator. Please use one of +, -, *, /.\")\n\n# This line runs the function when the script is executed\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    simple_calculator()\n```\n\n---\n\n### How It Works: A Step-by-Step Explanation\n\n1.  **Get User Input**:\n    *   `input()`: This function prompts the user to enter data and reads it as a string.\n    *   `float()`: We convert the input strings to floating-point numbers to allow for decimal calculations (e.g., `5.5 * 2`).\n    *   `try...except ValueError`: This is an important error-handling block. If the user enters text instead of a number (e.g., \"five\"), the `float()` conversion will fail and raise a `ValueError`. The `except` block catches this error and prints a user-friendly message instead of crashing the program.\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation**:\n    *   An `if/elif/else` statement checks which operator the user entered.\n    *   Based on the operator, it performs the corresponding mathematical operation.\n\n3.  **Handle Division by Zero**:\n    *   Division by zero is mathematically undefined and would cause an error in Python (`ZeroDivisionError`).\n    *   We add a special `if num2 == 0:` check inside the division block (`elif operator == '/'`) to prevent this error and inform the user.\n\n4.  **Display the Result**:\n    *   `f-string` (e.g., `f\"Result: {num1} + {num2} = {result}\"`): This is a modern and readable way to format strings in Python. It automatically inserts the values of the variables inside the curly braces `{}` into the string.\n\n5.  **Run the Code**:\n    *   The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block is standard Python practice. It ensures that the `simple_calculator()` function is called only when the script is run directly.\n\n### How to Run the Code\n\n1.  **Save the code**: Copy the code above and save it in a file named `calculator.py`.\n2.  **Open a terminal or command prompt**:\n    *   On Windows, search for \"Command Prompt\" or \"PowerShell\".\n    *   On macOS or Linux, open the \"Terminal\" application.\n3.  **Navigate to the file location**: Use the `cd` command to go to the directory where you saved `calculator.py`.\n    ```bash\n    # Example: if you saved it on your Desktop\n    cd Desktop\n    ```\n4.  **Execute the script**: Run the file using the Python interpreter.\n    ```bash\n    python calculator.py\n    ```\n\nThe program will then start, and you can interact with it directly in your terminal.\n\nI hope this helps you get started! Let me know if you'd like to see a more advanced version, perhaps one that can handle multiple calculations in a row."

          "text": "Thank you for sharing Revanth Akula's resume. I have processed the document and can provide a detailed analysis.\n\nBased on the resume, Revanth is a proactive and ambitious first-year B.Tech student specializing in AI & Machine Learning. He has a strong academic background and is actively building a practical skill set through projects and certifications.\n\nHere is a summary and constructive feedback to help enhance the resume's impact.\n\n### Summary of Revanth's Profile\n\n*   **Objective:** A first-year Computer Science student with a specialization in AIML.\n*   **Academics:** Excellent academic record with 97.6% in Senior Secondary and a 9.8 GPA in Secondary school.\n*   **Skills:** Possesses a foundational knowledge of C/C++, Python, web development (HTML, CSS, JS, Flask), and databases (MySQL). He is also familiar with core CS concepts like Data Structures, OOPs, and Operating Systems.\n*   **Projects:** Has initiated projects across different domains, including Machine Learning (Sign Language Detection), Frontend Development (Amazon Clone), and Full-Stack Development (Personal Portfolio).\n\n---\n\n### Constructive Feedback and Recommendations\n\nThis is a very strong resume for a student who has just started their B.Tech program. The following suggestions are aimed at refining the document to make it even more professional and effective for future internship or job applications.\n\n#### 1. **Clarify Academic Scores**\n*   **Issue:** The scores for B.Tech (\"8.8%\") and Secondary school (\"9.8%\") are likely CGPA/GPA scores but are represented with a '%' sign. This can be confusing for recruiters.\n*   **Recommendation:** Correct the format to reflect the scoring system accurately.\n    *   Change `8.8%` to **8.8 CGPA** (or specify the scale, e.g., 8.8/10).\n    *   Change `9.8%` to **9.8 GPA**.\n\n#### 2. **Review Project Timelines**\n*   **Issue:** All three projects are listed with the exact same timeframe (June 2025 - July 2025). It is highly ambitious and potentially unrealistic to complete three significant projects in the same two-month period. Recruiters may question the depth of each project.\n*   **Recommendation:**\n    *   Adjust the dates to reflect a more realistic timeline. If they were worked on sequentially or in parallel over a longer period, represent that.\n    *   If these are projects you *plan* to do, they should be moved to a separate \"Planned Projects\" or \"Academic Projects\" section, or omitted until completed. A resume should primarily reflect completed work.\n\n#### 3. **Quantify Project Achievements**\n*   **Issue:** The project descriptions are good but lack specific, measurable outcomes.\n*   **Recommendation:** Add metrics or specific details to showcase the impact and complexity of your work.\n\n    **Example for \"Sign Language Detection\":**\n    *   **Current:** \"We have built an ML model that will take a video as input and give the word that the person is showing.\"\n    *   **Improved:** \"Developed a real-time Sign Language Detection model using TensorFlow and OpenCV. Trained the model on a dataset of 5,000 images, achieving **92% accuracy** in identifying 10 different words from live video input.\"\n\n#### 4. **Enhance the \"Technical Skills\" Section**\n*   **Issue:** Using \"(familiar)\" can signal a lack of confidence. The \"Deep learning\" subsection is empty.\n*   **Recommendation:**\n    *   **Remove \"(familiar)\"**: Simply list the technologies. Be prepared to discuss your level of proficiency in an interview. Let your projects demonstrate your skills.\n    *   **Complete or Remove Empty Sections**: Either add the specific Deep Learning frameworks you are learning (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch) or remove the \"Deep learning\" heading until you have skills to list there.\n    *   **Organize Skills**: Group skills for better readability.\n\n    **Example of a Revised Skills Section:**\n    *   **Languages:** C, C++, Python\n    *   **Web Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Flask, Django\n    *   **Databases:** MySQL, MongoDB\n    *   **Developer Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code\n    *   **CS Fundamentals:** Data Structures & Algorithms, OOPs, Operating Systems\n\n#### 5. **Proofread and Refine**\n*   **Issue:** There are minor typos and inconsistencies (e.g., \"Hanker Ranker\" is likely **HackerRank**; inconsistent spacing).\n*   **Recommendation:**\n    *   Carefully proofread the entire document. Attention to detail is a critical professional skill.\n    *   Ensure contact information includes clickable hyperlinks for your email, LinkedIn, and GitHub profiles. For example, instead of just `linkedin /github`, provide the full, clickable URLs.\n\n### Revised Resume Snippet (Example)\n\nHere is how a section could look after applying the feedback:\n\n---\n**PROJECTS**\n\n\u2022 **Sign Language Detection** | *Personal Project* | Jun. 2025 \u2013 Jul. 2025\n  \u2013 Developed a real-time Sign Language Detection model using TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV to translate gestures into text.\n  \u2013 Achieved **92% accuracy** on a custom dataset of 10 common words.\n  \u2013 **Technologies Used:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV\n  \u2013 **[GitHub Link]**\n\n\u2022 **Full-Stack Personal Portfolio** | *Web Development* | May 2025 \u2013 Jun. 2025\n  \u2013 Designed and deployed a dynamic personal portfolio website to showcase projects and skills.\n  \u2013 Implemented a Flask backend with a MySQL database to manage project data and a contact form.\n  \u2013 **Technologies Used:** Flask, Python, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap\n  \u2013 **[Live Link] [GitHub Link]**\n\n---\n\nThis is an excellent start for a first-year student. By making these small adjustments, Revanth can create a more polished, professional, and impactful resume."
