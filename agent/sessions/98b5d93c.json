This can be achieved through various methods, such as:\n\n*   **Eye-tracking:** Using your eye movements to control the pointer.\n*   **Head-tracking:** Moving your head to guide the cursor.\n*   **Hand gestures:** Using a camera to detect hand movements and translate them into mouse actions.\n*   **Speech recognition:** Voice commands to click, drag, or move the cursor.\n*   **Software simulations:** Programs that allow keyboard keys or other input devices to mimic mouse functions.\n\nIt's often used for accessibility, in virtual reality/augmented reality environments, or when a physical mouse isn't practical or available."
