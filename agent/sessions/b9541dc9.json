          "text": "Of course. As a Senior Principal AI Architect, I'll provide you with a few options, starting from a basic, easy-to-understand script and progressing to a more advanced and robust solution.\n\n### Option 1: Simple Command-Line Calculator\n\nThis is a great starting point for beginners. It handles two numbers and one basic operation (+, -, \\*, /) at a time. The code is well-commented to explain each part.\n\n#### Key Features:\n*   Function-based for clarity and reuse.\n*   Continuous loop so you can perform multiple calculations.\n*   Robust error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., text instead of numbers, division by zero).\n\n#### Python Code\n\n```python\n# calculator_simple.py\n\ndef add(x, y):\n    \"\"\"This function adds two numbers\"\"\"\n    return x + y\n\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    \"\"\"This function subtracts two numbers\"\"\"\n    return x - y\n\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    \"\"\"This function multiplies two numbers\"\"\"\n    return x * y\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n    \"\"\"This function divides two numbers\"\"\"\n    if y == 0:\n        return \"Error! Division by zero is not allowed.\"\n    return x / y\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"The main function to run the calculator program.\"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Simple Python Calculator ---\")\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nSelect operation:\")\n        print(\"1. Add\")\n        print(\"2. Subtract\")\n        print(\"3. Multiply\")\n        print(\"4. Divide\")\n        print(\"5. Exit\")\n\n        # Get user's choice\n        choice = input(\"Enter choice(1/2/3/4/5): \")\n\n        # Check if the user wants to exit\n        if choice == '5':\n            print(\"Exiting calculator. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n\n        # Check if the choice is one of the four options\n        if choice in ('1', '2', '3', '4'):\n            try:\n                num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n                num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n            except ValueError:\n                print(\"Invalid input. Please enter numeric values.\")\n                continue # Skip the rest of this loop and start over\n\n            if choice == '1':\n                print(f\"{num1} + {num2} = {add(num1, num2)}\")\n\n            elif choice == '2':\n                print(f\"{num1} - {num2} = {subtract(num1, num2)}\")\n\n            elif choice == '3':\n                print(f\"{num1} * {num2} = {multiply(num1, num2)}\")\n\n            elif choice == '4':\n                result = divide(num1, num2)\n                print(f\"{num1} / {num2} = {result}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please select a valid operation (1-5).\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### How to Run It:\n1.  Save the code above as a file named `calculator_simple.py`.\n2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.\n3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n4.  Run the script with the command: `python calculator_simple.py`\n\n---\n\n### Option 2: Advanced Calculator using `eval()`\n\nThis version is much more powerful. It can evaluate a full mathematical expression like `(5 + 3) * 10 / 2`, respecting the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). It uses Python's built-in `eval()` function.\n\n**CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING:** The `eval()` function is extremely powerful but can be a major security risk if you use it on input from an untrusted source. It can execute *any* Python code. For this personal calculator tool, it's fine, but **never** use `eval()` on user input in a web application or other production environment.\n\n#### Key Features:\n*   Evaluates complex mathematical strings.\n*   Simple and concise code.\n*   Includes basic error handling for invalid expressions.\n\n#### Python Code\n\n```python\n# calculator_eval.py\n\nimport math # Import math module to allow its functions in eval\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function to run an expression-based calculator.\"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Advanced Expression Calculator ---\")\n    print(\"Enter a mathematical expression (e.g., 5 * (3 + 4))\")\n    print(\"Type 'quit' or 'exit' to end the program.\")\n    print(\"You can use functions from the math module, e.g., math.sqrt(16)\")\n\n    while True:\n        # Prompt the user for an expression\n        expression = input(\"\\n> \")\n\n        # Check for exit command\n        if expression.lower() in ['quit', 'exit']:\n            print(\"Exiting calculator. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n\n        try:\n            # IMPORTANT: eval() can be dangerous. Use only in controlled environments.\n            # We are passing the 'math' module to the globals of eval to make it available.\n            result = eval(expression, {\"__builtins__\": None}, {\"math\": math})\n            print(f\"Result: {result}\")\n\n        except (SyntaxError, NameError, TypeError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:\n            # Catch potential errors from eval() and report them\n            print(f\"Error: Invalid expression. Details: {e}\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            # Catch any other unexpected errors\n            print(f\"An unexpected error occurred: {e}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n#### How to Run It:\n1.  Save the code above as a file named `calculator_eval.py`.\n2.  Run it from your terminal: `python calculator_eval.py`\n3.  Try typing in expressions like `100 / (2 + 3)` or `math.pow(2, 8)`.\n\n---\n\n### Architectural Recommendation\n\n| Feature | Option 1: Simple Calculator | Option 2: `eval()` Calculator | Recommendation |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Simplicity** | Easy to understand, great for learning. | Extremely concise code. | **Option 1** for beginners learning core concepts. |\n| **Power** | Limited to one operation at a time. | Can handle complex nested expressions. | **Option 2** for pure functionality and power. |\n| **Safety** | Very safe. Explicitly defined functions. | **DANGEROUS** with untrusted input. | **Option 1** for any shared or production-like environment. |\n| **Extensibility** | Easy to add new custom functions (e.g., `power`, `sqrt`). | Already supports any valid Python math. | **Option 1** provides a better structure for controlled expansion. |\n\nFor most learning purposes and for building a robust application, **Option 1 is the superior architectural choice.** It is explicit, safe, and teaches fundamental programming principles like functions, loops, and error handling. Option 2 is a clever shortcut but is not a pattern to be used in serious application development."
