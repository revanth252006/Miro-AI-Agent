Here are some key characteristics:\n\n*   **Large Datasets:** Data mining works best with substantial volumes of data.\n*   **Pattern Discovery:** Its primary goal is to identify hidden patterns, relationships, and anomalies.\n*   **Automated/Semi-Automated Process:** Data mining uses algorithms to automate the pattern discovery process, often requiring minimal human intervention.\n*   **Predictive Analysis:** It's used to predict future trends and behaviors.\n*   **Actionable Insights:** The insights gained should be useful for decision-making and problem-solving.\n*   **Interdisciplinary:** It combines techniques from computer science, statistics, and database management.\n*   **Iterative:** Data mining is often an iterative process, requiring refinement and experimentation.\n\nYou can represent these characteristics in a diagram with \"Data Mining\" at the center and each characteristic branching out as a key aspect. Good luck!\n"

There would often be feedback loops, for example, from \"Evaluation\" back to \"Data Preparation\" or \"Modeling\" if the results aren't satisfactory. Good luck creating your flowchart!\n"
