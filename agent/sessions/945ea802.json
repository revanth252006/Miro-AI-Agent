What are you trying to find out? What is the context of the data?\n\n2.  **Data Selection:**  Here, you select the relevant data from the available datasets. This involves identifying the data that will be used for the knowledge discovery process and creating a target dataset.\n\n3.  **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** This step focuses on cleaning the data by removing noise, handling missing values, and resolving inconsistencies.  Preprocessing might also include tasks like data type conversion or normalization.\n\n4.  **Data Transformation (and Reduction):** The data is transformed into a suitable format for data mining. This might involve techniques like dimensionality reduction (reducing the number of variables) or feature engineering (creating new features from existing ones).\n\n5.  **Data Mining (Algorithm Selection):** This is the core step where data mining algorithms are applied to the transformed data to extract patterns.  This involves selecting the appropriate data mining task (e.g., classification, regression, clustering, association rule mining) and choosing the right algorithm(s) to use.\n\n6.  **Pattern Evaluation (Identification of Interesting Patterns):** The discovered patterns are evaluated to identify the interesting ones representing knowledge. This involves using measures of interestingness to assess the patterns' significance and validity.\n\n7.  **Using Discovered Knowledge:** The discovered knowledge is used to achieve the goals of the KDD process. This might involve reporting the knowledge, incorporating it into a decision-making process, or using it to support further analysis.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n"
