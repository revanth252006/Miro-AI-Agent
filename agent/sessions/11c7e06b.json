They focus on processing individual transactions quickly and efficiently, ensuring data accuracy and consistency. Key characteristics include:\n\n*   **Purpose:** Day-to-day operational tasks (e.g., order entry, banking transactions).\n*   **Data:** Current, detailed data.\n*   **Operations:** Short, frequent transactions (e.g., inserting, updating, deleting records).\n*   **Database Design:** Normalized database schema for minimizing redundancy and ensuring data integrity.\n*   **Users:** Operational staff.\n\n**OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)** systems are designed for analyzing large volumes of historical data to identify trends, patterns, and insights for decision-making. Key characteristics include:\n\n*   **Purpose:** Data analysis and business intelligence (e.g., sales forecasting, market analysis).\n*   **Data:** Historical, summarized data.\n*   **Operations:** Complex queries involving aggregations, calculations, and comparisons.\n*   **Database Design:** Denormalized database schema (e.g., star schema, snowflake schema) optimized for fast querying.\n*   **Users:** Managers, analysts, and executives.\n\nIn short, OLTP is for running the business, while OLAP is for analyzing the business. OLTP prioritizes speed and accuracy for current transactions, while OLAP prioritizes analysis of historical data for strategic decision-making.\n"

This could include handling missing values, smoothing noisy data, identifying outliers, and resolving inconsistencies. A clean dataset is crucial for accurate results.\n\n2.  **Data Integration:** (0.5 mark) If the data comes from multiple sources, this step merges data from various sources into a coherent data store, like a data warehouse.\n\n3.  **Data Selection:** (0.5 mark) In this step, relevant data for the analysis is selected from the integrated dataset. This involves identifying the attributes or features that will be used in the data mining process.\n\n4.  **Data Transformation:** (0.5 mark) The selected data is transformed into a suitable format for data mining. This may involve normalization (scaling values to a specific range), aggregation (summarizing data), generalization (creating hierarchies), or feature construction (creating new attributes from existing ones).\n\n5.  **Data Mining:** (0.5 mark) This is the core step where intelligent methods are applied to extract data patterns. This can involve using techniques like association rule mining, classification, clustering, regression, etc.\n\n6.  **Pattern Evaluation:** (0.5 mark)  The patterns discovered in the previous step are evaluated to identify truly interesting patterns representing knowledge. This may involve statistical measures, visualization, or domain expertise.\n\n7.  **Knowledge Representation:** (0.5 mark) The discovered knowledge is visually represented to the user. This can be done using reports, tables, graphs, or other visualization techniques. The extracted knowledge is then used for decision-making.\n\nThis detailed explanation along with the diagram provides a clear understanding of the KDD process and its various steps.
