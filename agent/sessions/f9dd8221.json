          "text": "Of course! I'd be happy to give you the Python code for a calculator.\n\nI'll provide two versions:\n1.  **A Simple Calculator:** A straightforward script that performs one calculation and then exits.\n2.  **A More Advanced Calculator:** A more robust version that uses functions, handles errors gracefully, and runs in a loop so you can perform multiple calculations until you choose to exit.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Simple Command-Line Calculator\n\nThis is a great starting point. It asks for two numbers and an operator, then prints the result.\n\n```python\n# A simple command-line calculator\n\n# 1. Get user input\ntry:\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    op = input(\"Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\nelse:\n    # 2. Perform the calculation based on the operator\n    if op == '+':\n        result = num1 + num2\n        print(f\"The result is: {result}\")\n    elif op == '-':\n        result = num1 - num2\n        print(f\"The result is: {result}\")\n    elif op == '*':\n        result = num1 * num2\n        print(f\"The result is: {result}\")\n    elif op == '/':\n        # Handle division by zero error\n        if num2 == 0:\n            print(\"Error: Cannot divide by zero.\")\n        else:\n            result = num1 / num2\n            print(f\"The result is: {result}\")\n    else:\n        # Handle invalid operator\n        print(\"Invalid operator. Please use +, -, *, or /.\")\n\n```\n\n#### How it Works:\n*   **`input()`**: This function prompts the user and reads a line of text from the keyboard.\n*   **`float()`**: The `input()` function returns text (a string). We use `float()` to convert the string into a floating-point number (a number that can have a decimal), which allows us to perform math.\n*   **`try...except ValueError`**: This block handles cases where the user types something that isn't a number (like \"hello\"). If a `ValueError` occurs during the `float()` conversion, the `except` block is executed, printing an error message.\n*   **`if/elif/else`**: This structure checks which operator the user entered (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and runs the appropriate calculation.\n*   **Division by Zero Check**: It specifically checks if the user is trying to divide by `0` before performing the division, which would otherwise crash the program.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Advanced Calculator (with Functions and a Loop)\n\nThis version is much more reusable and user-friendly. It defines functions for each operation and loops continuously, asking the user what they want to do next.\n\n```python\n# An advanced calculator with functions and a continuous loop\n\n# --- Function Definitions ---\n\ndef add(x, y):\n    \"\"\"This function adds two numbers\"\"\"\n    return x + y\n\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    \"\"\"This function subtracts two numbers\"\"\"\n    return x - y\n\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    \"\"\"This function multiplies two numbers\"\"\"\n    return x * y\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n    \"\"\"This function divides two numbers\"\"\"\n    if y == 0:\n        return \"Error: Cannot divide by zero.\"\n    return x / y\n\n# --- Main Program Loop ---\n\nprint(\"Welcome to Miro's Python Calculator!\")\n\nwhile True:\n    # Display the menu\n    print(\"\\nPlease select an operation:\")\n    print(\"1. Add\")\n    print(\"2. Subtract\")\n    print(\"3. Multiply\")\n    print(\"4. Divide\")\n    print(\"5. Exit\")\n\n    # Get the user's choice\n    choice = input(\"Enter choice (1/2/3/4/5): \")\n\n    # Check if the user wants to exit\n    if choice == '5':\n        print(\"Thank you for using the calculator. Goodbye!\")\n        break\n\n    # Check for a valid operation choice\n    if choice in ('1', '2', '3', '4'):\n        try:\n            num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n            num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter numbers only.\")\n            continue # This skips the rest of the loop and starts over\n\n        if choice == '1':\n            print(f\"Result: {num1} + {num2} = {add(num1, num2)}\")\n        elif choice == '2':\n            print(f\"Result: {num1} - {num2} = {subtract(num1, num2)}\")\n        elif choice == '3':\n            print(f\"Result: {num1} * {num2} = {multiply(num1, num2)}\")\n        elif choice == '4':\n            print(f\"Result: {num1} / {num2} = {divide(num1, num2)}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please select a valid option (1-5).\")\n\n```\n\n#### How to Run the Code:\n1.  Open a text editor (like VS Code, Notepad, etc.).\n2.  Copy and paste one of the code blocks above.\n3.  Save the file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `calculator.py`).\n4.  Open your terminal or command prompt.\n5.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n6.  Run the script by typing `python calculator.py` and pressing Enter.\n\n#### Key Improvements in the Advanced Version:\n*   **Functions (`def`)**: The code is organized into functions (`add`, `subtract`, etc.). This makes the code cleaner, easier to read, and reusable.\n*   **`while True:` loop**: This creates an infinite loop that keeps the program running, so you can perform one calculation after another without restarting the script.\n*   **Menu System**: It presents a clear menu of options to the user.\n*   **`break`**: The `break` statement is used to exit the `while` loop when the user chooses '5'.\n*   **`continue`**: If the user enters invalid numbers, the `continue` statement immediately jumps to the beginning of the next loop iteration, asking for a menu choice again.\n\nLet me know if you'd like any modifications or another type of code"
