It helps in data governance, data quality, and data understanding.\n\n*   **Data Mart:** A subject-oriented, often smaller, version of a data warehouse. It focuses on a specific business area or department (e.g., marketing, sales). Data marts provide targeted data for analysis and decision-making within that specific area.\n"

It contains foreign keys that reference dimension tables, linking the facts to contextual information. Examples of facts include sales amounts, quantities sold, or transaction counts.\n\n*   **Dimension Table:** Provides context and descriptive attributes about the facts in a fact table. Dimension tables contain attributes like dates, locations, products, customer details, etc. They enable slicing and dicing of data for analysis. They are joined to the fact table via foreign keys.\n"
