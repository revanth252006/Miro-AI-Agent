        "Of course! As Miro Agent, I'd be happy to provide you with the Python code for a simple calculator.\n\nHere is a clear, well-commented, and robust version that handles basic operations and common errors.\n\n### Simple Calculator Code\n\nThis code will prompt the user to enter two numbers and an operator, then it will display the result.\n\n```python\n# Simple Calculator in Python\n# Created by Miro Agent for a clear and functional example.\n\ndef simple_calculator():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function runs a simple command-line calculator that performs\n    addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Simple Python Calculator ---\")\n    print(\"You can perform addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\")\n\n    try:\n        # 1. Get the first number from the user\n        num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n\n        # 2. Get the operator from the user\n        operator = input(\"Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n\n        # 3. Get the second number from the user\n        num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    except ValueError:\n        # Handle cases where the input is not a valid number\n        print(\"\\nError: Invalid input. Please enter valid numbers.\")\n        return\n\n    # 4. Perform the calculation based on the operator\n    if operator == '+':\n        result = num1 + num2\n        print(f\"\\nResult: {num1} + {num2} = {result}\")\n\n    elif operator == '-':\n        result = num1 - num2\n        print(f\"\\nResult: {num1} - {num2} = {result}\")\n\n    elif operator == '*':\n        result = num1 * num2\n        print(f\"\\nResult: {num1} * {num2} = {result}\")\n\n    elif operator == '/':\n        # Handle the special case of division by zero\n        if num2 == 0:\n            print(\"\\nError: Cannot divide by zero.\")\n        else:\n            result = num1 / num2\n            print(f\"\\nResult: {num1} / {num2} = {result}\")\n\n    else:\n        # Handle cases where the operator is not one of the valid options\n        print(\"\\nError: Invalid operator. Please use one of +, -, *, /.\")\n\n# This line runs the function when the script is executed\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    simple_calculator()\n```\n\n---\n\n### How It Works: A Step-by-Step Explanation\n\n1.  **Get User Input**:\n    *   `input()`: This function prompts the user to enter data and reads it as a string.\n    *   `float()`: We convert the input strings to floating-point numbers to allow for decimal calculations (e.g., `5.5 * 2`).\n    *   `try...except ValueError`: This is an important error-handling block. If the user enters text instead of a number (e.g., \"five\"), the `float()` conversion will fail and raise a `ValueError`. The `except` block catches this error and prints a user-friendly message instead of crashing the program.\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation**:\n    *   An `if/elif/else` statement checks which operator the user entered.\n    *   Based on the operator, it performs the corresponding mathematical operation.\n\n3.  **Handle Division by Zero**:\n    *   Division by zero is mathematically undefined and would cause an error in Python (`ZeroDivisionError`).\n    *   We add a special `if num2 == 0:` check inside the division block (`elif operator == '/'`) to prevent this error and inform the user.\n\n4.  **Display the Result**:\n    *   `f-string` (e.g., `f\"Result: {num1} + {num2} = {result}\"`): This is a modern and readable way to format strings in Python. It automatically inserts the values of the variables inside the curly braces `{}` into the string.\n\n5.  **Run the Code**:\n    *   The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block is standard Python practice. It ensures that the `simple_calculator()` function is called only when the script is run directly.\n\n### How to Run the Code\n\n1.  **Save the code**: Copy the code above and save it in a file named `calculator.py`.\n2.  **Open a terminal or command prompt**:\n    *   On Windows, search for \"Command Prompt\" or \"PowerShell\".\n    *   On macOS or Linux, open the \"Terminal\" application.\n3.  **Navigate to the file location**: Use the `cd` command to go to the directory where you saved `calculator.py`.\n    ```bash\n    # Example: if you saved it on your Desktop\n    cd Desktop\n    ```\n4.  **Execute the script**: Run the file using the Python interpreter.\n    ```bash\n    python calculator.py\n    ```\n\nThe program will then start, and you can interact with it directly in your terminal.\n\nI hope this helps you get started! Let me know if you'd like to see a more advanced version, perhaps one that can handle multiple calculations in a row."

        "Thanks for asking! Here's a breakdown of some features Google Gemini might have that I currently don't:\n\n*   **Real-time Information & Web Access:** Gemini likely has more robust, real-time access to the internet for up-to-the-minute information. My knowledge is based on the data I was trained on, which has a cutoff point.\n\n*   **Multimodal Input/Output:** Gemini is designed to handle a wider variety of inputs and outputs, including images, audio, and video directly. My primary focus is text-based interaction.\n\n*   **Deep Integration with Google Services:** Gemini likely has tighter integrations with the Google ecosystem (Gmail, Docs, Calendar, etc.) for seamless workflow.\n\n*   **Continuous Learning & Adaptation:** While I am constantly being updated, Gemini's learning and adaptation processes may be more advanced, allowing it to evolve more rapidly with new information.\n\n*   **Advanced Reasoning and Problem Solving:** Gemini may have more sophisticated capabilities in complex reasoning, problem-solving, and creative content generation due to its architecture and training data.\n\nI am still under development, and my capabilities will continue to evolve! I'm focused on providing helpful, accurate, and efficient responses within my current capabilities.\n"
