        "Of course. I can provide you with the Python code for a simple calculator.\n\nI will provide two versions:\n1.  **A simple, straightforward script** that is easy for beginners to understand.\n2.  **A more robust version using functions**, which is a better programming practice for organization and scalability.\n\n---\n\n### Version 1: Simple & Straightforward Script\n\nThis version is a single script that prompts the user for two numbers and an operator, then calculates and displays the result. It includes basic error handling for invalid input and division by zero.\n\n```python\n# Miro Agent's Simple Calculator - Version 1\n\nprint(\"--- Simple Calculator ---\")\n\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        # Get user input and convert to float (to handle decimal numbers)\n        num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n        num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n        # Get the operation choice\n        operator = input(\"Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n\n        # Perform the calculation based on the operator\n        if operator == '+':\n            result = num1 + num2\n            print(f\"The result is: {num1} + {num2} = {result}\")\n\n        elif operator == '-':\n            result = num1 - num2\n            print(f\"The result is: {num1} - {num2} = {result}\")\n\n        elif operator == '*':\n            result = num1 * num2\n            print(f\"The result is: {num1} * {num2} = {result}\")\n\n        elif operator == '/':\n            # Handle the division by zero error\n            if num2 == 0:\n                print(\"Error: Cannot divide by zero.\")\n            else:\n                result = num1 / num2\n                print(f\"The result is: {num1} / {num2} = {result}\")\n\n        else:\n            print(\"Error: Invalid operator. Please use +, -, *, or /.\")\n\n    except ValueError:\n        # Handle cases where the input is not a number\n        print(\"Error: Invalid input. Please enter numeric values.\")\n\n    # Ask the user if they want to perform another calculation\n    another_calculation = input(\"\\nDo you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): \")\n    if another_calculation.lower() != 'yes':\n        print(\"Exiting the calculator. Goodbye!\")\n        break # Exit the while loop\n```\n\n#### How it Works:\n1.  **`while True:`**: This creates an infinite loop, allowing the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the script.\n2.  **`try...except ValueError`**: This block handles errors. If the user enters text instead of a number, `float()` will raise a `ValueError`. The `except` block catches this error and prints a friendly message instead of crashing the program.\n3.  **`input()`**: This function prompts the user and reads their text input from the command line.\n4.  **`if/elif/else`**: This structure checks which operator the user entered and performs the corresponding mathematical operation.\n5.  **Division by Zero Check**: A specific check `if num2 == 0:` is included to prevent a `ZeroDivisionError`, which would crash the program.\n6.  **Loop Control**: At the end, it asks the user if they want to continue. If they type anything other than 'yes' (case-insensitive), the `break` statement exits the `while` loop, ending the program.\n\n---\n\n### Version 2: Using Functions (Recommended Practice)\n\nThis version is more organized and modular. Each mathematical operation is its own function. This makes the code cleaner, easier to read, and easier to expand upon later.\n\n```python\n# Miro Agent's Simple Calculator - Version 2 (with Functions)\n\ndef add(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Adds two numbers together.\"\"\"\n    return x + y\n\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Subtracts the second number from the first.\"\"\"\n    return x - y\n\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Multiplies two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return x * y\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Divides the first number by the second. Returns an error string if division by zero.\"\"\"\n    if y == 0:\n        return \"Error: Cannot divide by zero.\"\n    return x / y\n\ndef run_calculator():\n    \"\"\"Main function to run the calculator loop.\"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Simple Calculator (Function-based) ---\")\n\n    # A dictionary to map operators to functions\n    operations = {\n        '+': add,\n        '-': subtract,\n        '*': multiply,\n        '/': divide\n    }\n\n    while True:\n        try:\n            num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n            num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n            # Print available operations\n            print(\"Select operation:\")\n            for symbol in operations:\n                print(symbol, end=' ')\n            print() # for a new line\n            \n            operator = input(\"Enter an operator: \")\n\n            if operator in operations:\n                # Get the function from the dictionary and call it\n                calculation_function = operations[operator]\n                result = calculation_function(num1, num2)\n                print(f\"The result is: {result}\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Error: Invalid operator.\")\n\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Error: Invalid input. Please enter numeric values.\")\n\n        # Ask to continue\n        another_calculation = input(\"\\nDo you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): \")\n        if another_calculation.lower() != 'yes':\n            print(\"Exiting the calculator. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n\n# Run the main calculator function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    run_calculator()\n```\n\n#### Key Improvements in Version 2:\n*   **Modularity**: Each operation is a separate function (`add`, `subtract`, etc.). This makes the code much cleaner.\n*   **Readability**: The main loop is easier to read because the complex logic is hidden inside the functions.\n*   **Scalability**: If you wanted to add new operations like exponentiation (`**`) or modulus (`%`), you would simply define a new function and add it to the `operations` dictionary.\n*   **Dictionary Mapping**: Using a dictionary (`operations`) to map operator symbols to functions is a very elegant and \"Pythonic\" way to replace a long `if/elif/else` chain.\n*   **`if __name__ == \"__main__\":`**: This is a standard Python convention that ensures the `run_calculator()` function is only called when the script is executed directly (not when it's imported as a module into another script).\n\nBoth versions accomplish the task, but the second one is a great example of writing cleaner and more maintainable code."

        "Of course! As Miro Agent, I'd be happy to provide you with the Python code for a simple calculator.\n\nHere is a clear, well-commented, and robust version that handles basic operations and common errors.\n\n### Simple Calculator Code\n\nThis code will prompt the user to enter two numbers and an operator, then it will display the result.\n\n```python\n# Simple Calculator in Python\n# Created by Miro Agent for a clear and functional example.\n\ndef simple_calculator():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function runs a simple command-line calculator that performs\n    addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Simple Python Calculator ---\")\n    print(\"You can perform addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\")\n\n    try:\n        # 1. Get the first number from the user\n        num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n\n        # 2. Get the operator from the user\n        operator = input(\"Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n\n        # 3. Get the second number from the user\n        num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    except ValueError:\n        # Handle cases where the input is not a valid number\n        print(\"\\nError: Invalid input. Please enter valid numbers.\")\n        return\n\n    # 4. Perform the calculation based on the operator\n    if operator == '+':\n        result = num1 + num2\n        print(f\"\\nResult: {num1} + {num2} = {result}\")\n\n    elif operator == '-':\n        result = num1 - num2\n        print(f\"\\nResult: {num1} - {num2} = {result}\")\n\n    elif operator == '*':\n        result = num1 * num2\n        print(f\"\\nResult: {num1} * {num2} = {result}\")\n\n    elif operator == '/':\n        # Handle the special case of division by zero\n        if num2 == 0:\n            print(\"\\nError: Cannot divide by zero.\")\n        else:\n            result = num1 / num2\n            print(f\"\\nResult: {num1} / {num2} = {result}\")\n\n    else:\n        # Handle cases where the operator is not one of the valid options\n        print(\"\\nError: Invalid operator. Please use one of +, -, *, /.\")\n\n# This line runs the function when the script is executed\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    simple_calculator()\n```\n\n---\n\n### How It Works: A Step-by-Step Explanation\n\n1.  **Get User Input**:\n    *   `input()`: This function prompts the user to enter data and reads it as a string.\n    *   `float()`: We convert the input strings to floating-point numbers to allow for decimal calculations (e.g., `5.5 * 2`).\n    *   `try...except ValueError`: This is an important error-handling block. If the user enters text instead of a number (e.g., \"five\"), the `float()` conversion will fail and raise a `ValueError`. The `except` block catches this error and prints a user-friendly message instead of crashing the program.\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation**:\n    *   An `if/elif/else` statement checks which operator the user entered.\n    *   Based on the operator, it performs the corresponding mathematical operation.\n\n3.  **Handle Division by Zero**:\n    *   Division by zero is mathematically undefined and would cause an error in Python (`ZeroDivisionError`).\n    *   We add a special `if num2 == 0:` check inside the division block (`elif operator == '/'`) to prevent this error and inform the user.\n\n4.  **Display the Result**:\n    *   `f-string` (e.g., `f\"Result: {num1} + {num2} = {result}\"`): This is a modern and readable way to format strings in Python. It automatically inserts the values of the variables inside the curly braces `{}` into the string.\n\n5.  **Run the Code**:\n    *   The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block is standard Python practice. It ensures that the `simple_calculator()` function is called only when the script is run directly.\n\n### How to Run the Code\n\n1.  **Save the code**: Copy the code above and save it in a file named `calculator.py`.\n2.  **Open a terminal or command prompt**:\n    *   On Windows, search for \"Command Prompt\" or \"PowerShell\".\n    *   On macOS or Linux, open the \"Terminal\" application.\n3.  **Navigate to the file location**: Use the `cd` command to go to the directory where you saved `calculator.py`.\n    ```bash\n    # Example: if you saved it on your Desktop\n    cd Desktop\n    ```\n4.  **Execute the script**: Run the file using the Python interpreter.\n    ```bash\n    python calculator.py\n    ```\n\nThe program will then start, and you can interact with it directly in your terminal.\n\nI hope this helps you get started! Let me know if you'd like to see a more advanced version, perhaps one that can handle multiple calculations in a row."
