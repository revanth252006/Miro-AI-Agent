        "Of course.\n\nDue to a temporary issue, I am unable to access live weather data at this moment.\n\nHowever, given that it is late January in Chicago, you can typically expect very cold weather. It's likely to be at or below freezing (32\u00b0F or 0\u00b0C), with a significant chance of snow and wind.\n\nFor the most accurate, up-to-the-minute forecast, I would recommend checking a reliable source like the National Weather Service, The Weather Channel, or by doing a quick search for \"weather in Chicago\" on your preferred search engine."

        "Of course. I can provide you with the Python code for a simple calculator.\n\nI will provide two versions:\n1.  **A simple, straightforward script** that is easy for beginners to understand.\n2.  **A more robust version using functions**, which is a better programming practice for organization and scalability.\n\n---\n\n### Version 1: Simple & Straightforward Script\n\nThis version is a single script that prompts the user for two numbers and an operator, then calculates and displays the result. It includes basic error handling for invalid input and division by zero.\n\n```python\n# Miro Agent's Simple Calculator - Version 1\n\nprint(\"--- Simple Calculator ---\")\n\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        # Get user input and convert to float (to handle decimal numbers)\n        num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n        num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n        # Get the operation choice\n        operator = input(\"Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n\n        # Perform the calculation based on the operator\n        if operator == '+':\n            result = num1 + num2\n            print(f\"The result is: {num1} + {num2} = {result}\")\n\n        elif operator == '-':\n            result = num1 - num2\n            print(f\"The result is: {num1} - {num2} = {result}\")\n\n        elif operator == '*':\n            result = num1 * num2\n            print(f\"The result is: {num1} * {num2} = {result}\")\n\n        elif operator == '/':\n            # Handle the division by zero error\n            if num2 == 0:\n                print(\"Error: Cannot divide by zero.\")\n            else:\n                result = num1 / num2\n                print(f\"The result is: {num1} / {num2} = {result}\")\n\n        else:\n            print(\"Error: Invalid operator. Please use +, -, *, or /.\")\n\n    except ValueError:\n        # Handle cases where the input is not a number\n        print(\"Error: Invalid input. Please enter numeric values.\")\n\n    # Ask the user if they want to perform another calculation\n    another_calculation = input(\"\\nDo you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): \")\n    if another_calculation.lower() != 'yes':\n        print(\"Exiting the calculator. Goodbye!\")\n        break # Exit the while loop\n```\n\n#### How it Works:\n1.  **`while True:`**: This creates an infinite loop, allowing the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the script.\n2.  **`try...except ValueError`**: This block handles errors. If the user enters text instead of a number, `float()` will raise a `ValueError`. The `except` block catches this error and prints a friendly message instead of crashing the program.\n3.  **`input()`**: This function prompts the user and reads their text input from the command line.\n4.  **`if/elif/else`**: This structure checks which operator the user entered and performs the corresponding mathematical operation.\n5.  **Division by Zero Check**: A specific check `if num2 == 0:` is included to prevent a `ZeroDivisionError`, which would crash the program.\n6.  **Loop Control**: At the end, it asks the user if they want to continue. If they type anything other than 'yes' (case-insensitive), the `break` statement exits the `while` loop, ending the program.\n\n---\n\n### Version 2: Using Functions (Recommended Practice)\n\nThis version is more organized and modular. Each mathematical operation is its own function. This makes the code cleaner, easier to read, and easier to expand upon later.\n\n```python\n# Miro Agent's Simple Calculator - Version 2 (with Functions)\n\ndef add(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Adds two numbers together.\"\"\"\n    return x + y\n\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Subtracts the second number from the first.\"\"\"\n    return x - y\n\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Multiplies two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return x * y\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Divides the first number by the second. Returns an error string if division by zero.\"\"\"\n    if y == 0:\n        return \"Error: Cannot divide by zero.\"\n    return x / y\n\ndef run_calculator():\n    \"\"\"Main function to run the calculator loop.\"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Simple Calculator (Function-based) ---\")\n\n    # A dictionary to map operators to functions\n    operations = {\n        '+': add,\n        '-': subtract,\n        '*': multiply,\n        '/': divide\n    }\n\n    while True:\n        try:\n            num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n            num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n            # Print available operations\n            print(\"Select operation:\")\n            for symbol in operations:\n                print(symbol, end=' ')\n            print() # for a new line\n            \n            operator = input(\"Enter an operator: \")\n\n            if operator in operations:\n                # Get the function from the dictionary and call it\n                calculation_function = operations[operator]\n                result = calculation_function(num1, num2)\n                print(f\"The result is: {result}\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Error: Invalid operator.\")\n\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Error: Invalid input. Please enter numeric values.\")\n\n        # Ask to continue\n        another_calculation = input(\"\\nDo you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): \")\n        if another_calculation.lower() != 'yes':\n            print(\"Exiting the calculator. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n\n# Run the main calculator function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    run_calculator()\n```\n\n#### Key Improvements in Version 2:\n*   **Modularity**: Each operation is a separate function (`add`, `subtract`, etc.). This makes the code much cleaner.\n*   **Readability**: The main loop is easier to read because the complex logic is hidden inside the functions.\n*   **Scalability**: If you wanted to add new operations like exponentiation (`**`) or modulus (`%`), you would simply define a new function and add it to the `operations` dictionary.\n*   **Dictionary Mapping**: Using a dictionary (`operations`) to map operator symbols to functions is a very elegant and \"Pythonic\" way to replace a long `if/elif/else` chain.\n*   **`if __name__ == \"__main__\":`**: This is a standard Python convention that ensures the `run_calculator()` function is only called when the script is executed directly (not when it's imported as a module into another script).\n\nBoth versions accomplish the task, but the second one is a great example of writing cleaner and more maintainable code."
