        "Of course! I can certainly provide you with the Python code to build a simple calculator. As Miro Agent, I'll give you two versions:\n\n1.  **A Basic, Straightforward Script:** Perfect for understanding the core logic.\n2.  **A More Structured Version Using Functions:** This is a better practice for writing clean, reusable, and scalable code.\n\n---\n\n### Version 1: The Basic Calculator Script\n\nThis version is a single script that prompts the user for two numbers and an operator, then prints the result. It's easy to understand for beginners.\n\n#### Code:\n\n```python\n# Miro Agent - Simple Calculator (Basic Version)\n\nprint(\"--- Simple Calculator ---\")\n\ntry:\n    # 1. Get user input and convert to numbers (float for decimals)\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    op = input(\"Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    result = None\n\n    # 2. Perform the calculation based on the operator\n    if op == '+':\n        result = num1 + num2\n    elif op == '-':\n        result = num1 - num2\n    elif op == '*':\n        result = num1 * num2\n    elif op == '/':\n        # Handle the division by zero error\n        if num2 == 0:\n            print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n        else:\n            result = num1 / num2\n    else:\n        print(\"Error: Invalid operator. Please use +, -, *, or /.\")\n\n    # 3. Display the result if a calculation was successful\n    if result is not None:\n        print(f\"The result is: {num1} {op} {num2} = {result}\")\n\nexcept ValueError:\n    # Handle cases where the input is not a valid number\n    print(\"Error: Invalid input. Please enter numeric values.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    # Catch any other unexpected errors\n    print(f\"An unexpected error occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\n#### How It Works:\n\n1.  **Get User Input**: It asks the user for two numbers and an operator. It uses `float()` to convert the input strings into numbers that can have decimal points.\n2.  **Error Handling (`try...except`)**: The entire logic is wrapped in a `try...except` block.\n    *   `try`: Python attempts to run this code.\n    *   `except ValueError`: If the user enters text instead of a number, `float()` will fail and raise a `ValueError`. This block catches that error and prints a user-friendly message.\n3.  **Perform Calculation**: It uses an `if/elif/else` chain to check which operator the user entered and then performs the corresponding arithmetic operation.\n4.  **Special Case (Division)**: It specifically checks if the user is trying to divide by zero, as this is mathematically impossible and would crash the program.\n5.  **Display Result**: If a valid operation was performed (`result` is no longer `None`), it prints the final answer in a nicely formatted f-string.\n\n---\n\n### Version 2: Structured Calculator with Functions and a Loop\n\nThis version is more robust. It uses functions to separate the logic for each operation and a `while` loop to allow the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the script.\n\n#### Code:\n\n```python\n# Miro Agent - Simple Calculator (Structured Version)\n\ndef add(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Adds two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return x + y\n\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Subtracts two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return x - y\n\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Multiplies two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return x * y\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Divides two numbers, with error handling for division by zero.\"\"\"\n    if y == 0:\n        return \"Error: Division by zero.\"\n    return x / y\n\ndef calculator():\n    \"\"\"Main function to run the calculator.\"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Advanced Calculator ---\")\n    print(\"Enter 'quit' to exit.\")\n\n    # Dictionary to map operators to functions\n    operations = {\n        '+': add,\n        '-': subtract,\n        '*': multiply,\n        '/': divide\n    }\n\n    while True:\n        # Get first number\n        num1_input = input(\"Enter the first number: \")\n        if num1_input.lower() == 'quit':\n            break\n        \n        # Get operator\n        op = input(\"Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n        if op.lower() == 'quit':\n            break\n\n        # Get second number\n        num2_input = input(\"Enter the second number: \")\n        if num2_input.lower() == 'quit':\n            break\n\n        try:\n            num1 = float(num1_input)\n            num2 = float(num2_input)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter numeric values. Starting over.\")\n            print(\"-\" * 20)\n            continue # Skip to the next loop iteration\n\n        # Look up the function in the dictionary and calculate\n        if op in operations:\n            calculation_function = operations[op]\n            result = calculation_function(num1, num2)\n            print(f\"Result: {result}\\n\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid operator. Please try again.\\n\")\n            \n        print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Thank you for using the calculator!\")\n\n# Run the main calculator function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculator()\n```\n\n#### Key Improvements in This Version:\n\n1.  **Functions for Operations**: Each mathematical operation (`add`, `subtract`, etc.) is in its own function. This makes the code cleaner, easier to read, and simpler to test or modify.\n2.  **Continuous Loop**: The `while True:` loop allows the user to perform calculation after calculation. The loop only stops when the user types `quit`.\n3.  **Dictionary for Operations**: Instead of a long `if/elif/else` chain, a dictionary `operations` maps the operator symbols (e.g., `'+'`) directly to their corresponding functions (e.g., `add`). This is a more efficient and scalable way to handle operations.\n4.  **Better User Experience**: The code provides clearer instructions, handles errors within the loop without crashing, and allows the user to exit gracefully.\n5.  **Main Guard (`if __name__ == \"__main__\":`)**: This is a standard Python best practice. It ensures that the `calculator()` function is only called when the script is executed directly (not when it's imported as a module into another script).\n\n### How to Run the Code\n\n1.  Open a text editor (like VS Code, Notepad++, or Sublime Text).\n2.  Copy and paste either version of the code into the editor.\n3.  Save the file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `calculator.py`).\n4.  Open a terminal or command prompt.\n5.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n6.  Run the script using the command: `python calculator.py`\n\nI recommend starting with Version 1 to understand the basics and then moving to Version 2 to learn about better coding practices.
