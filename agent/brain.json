        "Of course. Hello! I am Miro Agent, created by Revanth and his team to assist you.\n\nHere is the Python code for a simple, easy-to-understand calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. I will provide two versions:\n\n1.  A basic version that performs a single calculation.\n2.  An enhanced version that allows for continuous calculations until the user decides to exit.\n\n---\n\n### Version 1: Simple Single-Calculation Calculator\n\nThis code is perfect for beginners. It asks for two numbers and an operator, performs the calculation, prints the result, and then exits.\n\n**Code:**\n\n```python\n# simple_calculator.py\n\ndef add(x, y):\n    \"\"\"This function adds two numbers\"\"\"\n    return x + y\n\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    \"\"\"This function subtracts two numbers\"\"\"\n    return x - y\n\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    \"\"\"This function multiplies two numbers\"\"\"\n    return x * y\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n    \"\"\"This function divides two numbers\"\"\"\n    if y == 0:\n        return \"Error! Division by zero.\"\n    return x / y\n\nprint(\"Welcome to the Simple Calculator!\")\nprint(\"Select operation:\")\nprint(\"  + for Addition\")\nprint(\"  - for Subtraction\")\nprint(\"  * for Multiplication\")\nprint(\"  / for Division\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\ntry:\n    # Get input from the user\n    num1_str = input(\"Enter first number: \")\n    operator = input(\"Enter operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n    num2_str = input(\"Enter second number: \")\n\n    # Convert string inputs to floating-point numbers\n    num1 = float(num1_str)\n    num2 = float(num2_str)\n\n    result = None\n\n    # Perform the calculation based on the operator\n    if operator == '+':\n        result = add(num1, num2)\n    elif operator == '-':\n        result = subtract(num1, num2)\n    elif operator == '*':\n        result = multiply(num1, num2)\n    elif operator == '/':\n        result = divide(num1, num2)\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid operator. Please use one of +, -, *, /\")\n\n    # Display the result if a valid operation was performed\n    if result is not None:\n        print(f\"The result is: {num1} {operator} {num2} = {result}\")\n\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"Invalid input. Please enter valid numbers.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"An unexpected error occurred: {e}\")\n\n```\n\n#### How It Works:\n\n1.  **Functions for Operations**: We define separate functions (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`) for each mathematical operation. This makes the code clean and organized. The `divide` function includes a special check to prevent a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n2.  **User Input**: The `input()` function prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operator.\n3.  **Error Handling (`try...except`)**: The main logic is wrapped in a `try...except` block.\n    *   The `try` block attempts to convert the user's input into numbers (`float`) and perform the calculation.\n    *   If the user enters text that cannot be converted to a number (like \"hello\"), a `ValueError` occurs, and the `except ValueError` block is executed, printing a user-friendly error message instead of crashing the program.\n4.  **Calculation Logic**: An `if/elif/else` statement checks which operator the user entered and calls the corresponding function.\n5.  **Print Result**: The final result is printed in a clear, formatted string (f-string).\n\n---\n\n### Version 2: Enhanced Calculator with Continuous Calculations\n\nThis version is more practical. It wraps the logic in a `while` loop, allowing you to perform multiple calculations in a row without restarting the program.\n\n**Code:**\n\n```python\n# continuous_calculator.py\n\ndef add(x, y):\n    \"\"\"This function adds two numbers\"\"\"\n    return x + y\n\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    \"\"\"This function subtracts two numbers\"\"\"\n    return x - y\n\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    \"\"\"This function multiplies two numbers\"\"\"\n    return x * y\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n    \"\"\"This function divides two numbers\"\"\"\n    if y == 0:\n        return \"Error! Division by zero.\"\n    return x / y\n\nprint(\"Welcome to the Miro Calculator!\")\nprint(\"Enter 'exit' to quit at any time.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\nwhile True:  # Main loop to keep the calculator running\n    try:\n        # Get input from the user\n        num1_str = input(\"Enter first number: \")\n        if num1_str.lower() == 'exit':\n            break\n\n        operator = input(\"Enter operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n        if operator.lower() == 'exit':\n            break\n\n        num2_str = input(\"Enter second number: \")\n        if num2_str.lower() == 'exit':\n            break\n\n        # Convert string inputs to floating-point numbers\n        num1 = float(num1_str)\n        num2 = float(num2_str)\n\n        result = None\n\n        # Perform the calculation based on the operator\n        if operator == '+':\n            result = add(num1, num2)\n        elif operator == '-':\n            result = subtract(num1, num2)\n        elif operator == '*':\n            result = multiply(num1, num2)\n        elif operator == '/':\n            result = divide(num1, num2)\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid operator. Please use one of +, -, *, /\")\n\n        # Display the result if a valid operation was performed\n        if result is not None:\n            print(f\"Result: {num1} {operator} {num2} = {result}\")\n            print(\"-\" * 20) # Separator for the next calculation\n\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter valid numbers. Try again.\")\n        print(\"-\" * 20)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An unexpected error occurred: {e}\")\n        break # Exit on unexpected errors\n\nprint(\"Thank you for using the Miro Calculator!\")\n```\n\n#### Key Improvements in Version 2:\n\n1.  **`while True:` Loop**: This creates an infinite loop that keeps the program running.\n2.  **Exit Condition**: The user can type `exit` at any prompt to break out of the loop and end the program gracefully. The `.lower()` method ensures that `exit`, `Exit`, or `EXIT` will all work.\n3.  **User Experience**: A separator (`-` * 20) is printed after each calculation to make the interface cleaner for repeated use. Error messages guide the user to try again instead of ending the program.\n\nTo run either of these scripts, save the code in a file (e.g., `calculator.py`) and run it from your terminal using the command: `python calculator.py`."
