        "Of course. I can provide you with a Python code for a simple calculator.\n\nThis code will be easy to understand, well-commented, and will include error handling to make it robust against common user mistakes like entering text instead of numbers or trying to divide by zero.\n\nHere are two versions: a basic one and a more advanced one that runs in a loop.\n\n### Version 1: Basic, Single Calculation\n\nThis version performs one calculation and then exits. It's a great starting point for beginners.\n\n```python\n# --- A Basic Command-Line Calculator ---\n\n# 1. Get input from the user for the first number\ntry:\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n    exit()\n\n# 2. Get the operator\noperator = input(\"Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n\n# 3. Get input from the user for the second number\ntry:\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n    exit()\n\n# 4. Perform the calculation using if/elif/else\nif operator == '+':\n    result = num1 + num2\nelif operator == '-':\n    result = num1 - num2\nelif operator == '*':\n    result = num1 * num2\nelif operator == '/':\n    # Check for division by zero\n    if num2 == 0:\n        result = \"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\"\n    else:\n        result = num1 / num2\nelse:\n    result = \"Error: Invalid operator entered.\"\n\n# 5. Print the result\nprint(\"--------------------\")\n# We check if the result is a string (which means an error occurred)\nif isinstance(result, str):\n    print(result)\nelse:\n    print(f\"The result is: {num1} {operator} {num2} = {result}\")\nprint(\"--------------------\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### Version 2: Advanced, with Loops and Functions\n\nThis is a more complete and user-friendly version. It's wrapped in a function and uses a loop to allow the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the script.\n\n```python\n# --- An Advanced Command-Line Calculator ---\n\ndef simple_calculator():\n    \"\"\"\n    A simple calculator that runs in a loop, handling basic arithmetic\n    operations and user input errors gracefully.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Welcome to the Simple Python Calculator ---\")\n    print(\"You can type 'exit' at any time to quit the program.\")\n\n    while True:\n        # 1. Get the first number from the user\n        try:\n            num1_input = input(\"\\nEnter the first number: \")\n            # Allow user to exit\n            if num1_input.lower() == 'exit':\n                break\n            num1 = float(num1_input)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a numeric value.\")\n            continue # Skips the rest of the loop and starts a new one\n\n        # 2. Get the operator from the user\n        operator = input(\"Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n        if operator.lower() == 'exit':\n            break\n        # Check if the operator is valid\n        if operator not in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:\n            print(\"Invalid operator. Please use one of: +, -, *, /\")\n            continue\n\n        # 3. Get the second number from the user\n        try:\n            num2_input = input(\"Enter the second number: \")\n            if num2_input.lower() == 'exit':\n                break\n            num2 = float(num2_input)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a numeric value.\")\n            continue\n\n        # 4. Perform the calculation\n        if operator == '+':\n            result = num1 + num2\n        elif operator == '-':\n            result = num1 - num2\n        elif operator == '*':\n            result = num1 * num2\n        elif operator == '/':\n            if num2 == 0:\n                print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n                continue # Skip printing and start a new calculation\n            else:\n                result = num1 / num2\n        \n        # 5. Print the formatted result\n        print(\"-------------------------------------\")\n        print(f\"---> Result: {num1} {operator} {num2} = {result}\")\n        print(\"-------------------------------------\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThank you for using the calculator. Goodbye!\")\n\n# This line ensures the function runs only when the script is executed directly\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    simple_calculator()\n```\n\n### How to Use the Code\n\n1.  **Save the code:** Copy the code and save it in a file named `calculator.py`.\n2.  **Open a terminal or command prompt:**\n    *   On Windows, search for `cmd` or `PowerShell`.\n    *   On macOS or Linux, open the `Terminal` application.\n3.  **Navigate to the file's location:** Use the `cd` command to go to the directory where you saved the file. For example: `cd Downloads`.\n4.  **Run the script:** Type the following command and press Enter:\n    ```bash\n    python calculator.py\n    ```\n5.  **Follow the prompts:** The program will ask you to enter numbers and an operator.\n\nI recommend using the **second version** as it provides a much better user experience and is a great example of combining loops, functions, and error handling in Python.
