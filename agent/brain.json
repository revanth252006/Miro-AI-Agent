It's likely to be at or below freezing (32\u00b0F or 0\u00b0C), with a significant chance of snow and wind.\n\nFor the most accurate, up-to-the-minute forecast, I would recommend checking a reliable source like the National Weather Service, The Weather Channel, or by doing a quick search for \"weather in Chicago\" on your preferred search engine."
