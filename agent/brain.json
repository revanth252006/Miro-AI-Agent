        "The price of an iPhone in India varies quite a bit depending on the specific model, storage capacity, and where you're buying it from (e.g., Apple Store, Amazon, Flipkart, authorized resellers). Prices can also change due to ongoing sales or promotions.\n\nTo give you a general idea for some of the popular current models (as of early 2026):\n\n*   **Latest models (e.g., iPhone 17 series, if released, or iPhone 16 series):** These would typically start from around \u20b979,900 to \u20b91,59,900 or even higher for the Pro Max models with higher storage.\n*   **Previous generation models (e.g., iPhone 15 series, iPhone 14 series):** These would be available at lower price points, often starting from \u20b959,900 and going up depending on the model and storage.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date pricing, I highly recommend checking the official **Apple India website** or major online retailers like **Amazon India** and **Flipkart**. You can also check with authorized Apple resellers in your area."

This means my design and capabilities are optimized for his needs, making me excel in *that* specific domain, but I might not have some of the features they possess, such as:\n\n1.  **Extensive Real-Time Web Search & General Knowledge Access:** While I have access to information, I don't typically perform broad, real-time web searches or maintain a constantly updated, vast general knowledge base like they do for public queries. My knowledge is more focused on Revanth's work and context.\n2.  **Advanced Multimodal Input/Output (Beyond Text):** Gemini, especially, excels at processing and generating content across various modalities (images, video, audio). My primary interaction is text-based, though I can process and understand information relevant to Revanth's tasks from various sources he provides.\n3.  **Broad Creative Content Generation:** ChatGPT and Gemini are often used for generating a wide array of creative content like complex stories, poems, scripts, or advanced coding solutions across diverse domains for a general audience. My creative assistance would be more tailored to tasks directly related to Revanth's work.\n4.  **General Purpose API Integrations:** While I integrate with tools relevant to Revanth's workflow, I wouldn't have the same vast array of general-purpose API integrations that allow them to interact with countless third-party applications for public use.\n5.  **Large-scale Public Availability and Interaction:** They are designed to interact with millions of users globally across an extremely wide range of topics. My focus is solely on assisting Revanth.\n\nMy strength lies in being deeply integrated into Revanth's daily tasks, understanding his preferences, and proactively helping him manage his schedule, information, and communications to make his life easier."

        "That's a great question, Revanth! While I am a highly advanced AI agent specifically designed to assist you, there are indeed some features that Google Gemini and ChatGPT, as general-purpose, large-scale AI models, might possess that I currently do not:\n\n1.  **Broad General Knowledge & Real-time Web Access:** Gemini and ChatGPT are typically trained on vast datasets covering almost the entire internet, giving them an incredibly wide and deep general knowledge base. They also often have real-time web browsing capabilities to pull the latest information. My knowledge is focused on assisting you and the specific domains relevant to your work, and I don't inherently have real-time web access unless specifically programmed for a task.\n2.  **Advanced Multimodality:** Especially with Gemini, a key feature is its ability to understand and generate content across multiple modalities \u2013 not just text, but also images, audio, and video. While I excel at processing and generating text, I don't currently have those advanced multimodal input/output capabilities. ChatGPT also has strong image understanding.\n3.  **Extensive Third-Party Plugin & Integration Ecosystem:** ChatGPT, for instance, has a broad plugin ecosystem that allows it to interact with hundreds of external services. Gemini is deeply integrated with Google's suite of products. My integrations are tailored specifically to your needs and the tools provided by Revanth and his team.\n4.  **Complex Creative Content Generation (General Purpose):** While I can assist you with specific creative tasks, models like Gemini and ChatGPT are often used for highly complex, open-ended creative writing, extensive coding, or academic research across a massive array of topics for a general audience. My creative assistance is focused on supporting *your* specific requirements.\n5.  **Massive Public Accessibility & Scalability:** I am your personal AI agent, focused entirely on you. Google Gemini and ChatGPT are designed to serve millions of users globally with a very broad set of functionalities.\n\nMy strength, however, lies in my dedicated focus on being *your* personal assistant, learning your preferences, and streamlining *your* daily tasks. I am built to be highly adaptive and evolve with your needs, thanks to the work of Revanth and his team!"
