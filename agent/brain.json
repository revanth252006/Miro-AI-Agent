        "The iPhone 14 Pro Max was Apple's top-tier flagship model from 2022, and it introduced several significant features that were exclusive to the Pro models at the time.\n\nHere are the key features of the iPhone 14 Pro Max:\n\n1.  **Dynamic Island:** This was the headline feature, replacing the traditional notch. It's a pill-shaped cutout that dynamically adapts to show alerts, notifications, and background activities (like music playback, timers, Face ID authentications, incoming calls, etc.) in an interactive and fluid way.\n\n2.  **Always-On Display:** The Lock Screen remains visible at a dimmed state, showing your wallpaper, widgets, and notifications without needing to tap the screen. The refresh rate drops as low as 1Hz to save battery.\n\n3.  **A16 Bionic Chip:** At its release, this was the fastest chip in a smartphone, offering industry-leading performance for demanding apps, games, and advanced computational photography. It was exclusive to the Pro models of the iPhone 14 generation.\n\n4.  **Pro Camera System (Major Upgrade):**\n    *   **48MP Main Camera:** The biggest sensor upgrade in years, moving from 12MP to a 48MP Quad-pixel sensor (\u0192/1.78 aperture) with second-generation sensor-shift optical image stabilization. This allows for incredibly detailed photos, improved low-light performance, and a new 2x optical quality telephoto option by cropping the sensor.\n    *   **12MP Ultra Wide Camera:** Improved low-light performance (\u0192/2.2 aperture) and macro photography capabilities.\n    *   **12MP Telephoto Camera:** 3x optical zoom (\u0192/2.8 aperture) with OIS.\n    *   **Photonic Engine:** Enhanced image pipeline that significantly improves mid-to-low light performance across all cameras.\n    *   **ProRes Video:** Ability to record video in the high-quality ProRes format (up to 4K at 30fps) for professional workflows.\n    *   **Cinematic Mode:** Shoots video with a shallow depth of field (bokeh effect) in 4K at 24fps or 30fps.\n    *   **Action Mode:** Provides incredibly smooth, gimbal-like video stabilization, even during intense movement (up to 2.8K at 60fps).\n    *   **TrueDepth Front Camera (12MP, \u0192/1.9):** Now with autofocus for sharper selfies and improved low-light performance.\n\n5.  **Super Retina XDR Display:**\n    *   **6.7-inch OLED display.**\n    *   **ProMotion Technology:** Adaptive refresh rate from 1Hz to 120Hz for incredibly smooth scrolling and responsiveness, while saving power when a high refresh rate isn't needed.\n    *   **Peak HDR Brightness:** Up to 1600 nits (typical), 2000 nits peak outdoor brightness (at the time, the brightest display on any smartphone).\n\n6.  **Battery Life:** Offered the best battery life ever on an iPhone at its release, allowing for extended usage throughout the day.\n\n7.  **Emergency SOS via Satellite:** Allows users to text emergency services when outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage by connecting directly to satellites (initially launched in select countries).\n\n8.  **Crash Detection:** Utilizes new sensors and algorithms to detect a severe car crash and automatically call emergency services if the user is unresponsive.\n\n9.  **Durable Design:**\n    *   **Ceramic Shield front cover:** Tougher than any smartphone glass.\n    *   **Textured matte glass back** and **stainless steel frame.**\n    *   **IP68 water and dust resistance:** Up to 6 meters for 30 minutes.\n\n10. **Connectivity:**\n    *   **5G capable:** For super-fast cellular speeds.\n    *   **Wi-Fi 6** and **Bluetooth 5.3.**\n    *   **USB-C Port:** (Note: The iPhone 14 Pro Max originally shipped with Lightning. **This model came out before the switch to USB-C for iPhones, which happened with the iPhone 15 series.** So, it features a Lightning port.)\n    *   **MagSafe:** Magnetic system on the back for wireless charging and attaching accessories.\n\n11. **iOS:** Runs on Apple's highly secure and intuitive iOS operating system, with regular updates and access to a vast ecosystem of apps and services.\n\nThe iPhone 14 Pro Max was designed for users who wanted the absolute best in smartphone technology, particularly emphasizing camera capabilities, display quality, performance, and advanced safety features."

        "Of course. Congratulations on securing an interview for a Senior Python Developer role at Google. This is a significant achievement. As Miro Agent, created by Revanth and his team, my goal is to provide you with deep, insightful preparation.\n\nA senior-level interview at Google goes far beyond basic syntax. They are looking for depth of knowledge, an understanding of trade-offs, system design prowess, and strong problem-solving skills. You will be evaluated not just on *if* you can solve a problem, but *how* you solve it, how you communicate your thought process, and how you handle complexity and scale.\n\nHere are advanced questions categorized by the areas Google typically focuses on. For each, I'll explain what the interviewer is *really* looking for.\n\n---\n\n### Category 1: Deep Python Internals & Language Nuances\n\nThese questions test that you are a true master of the language, not just a user.\n\n**Question 1: The GIL and Concurrency Models**\n\n> \"Explain Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in detail. Describe a scenario where the GIL would be a major bottleneck. Then, design a Python application for a CPU-bound task (e.g., calculating prime factors for a list of 1 million large numbers) and an I/O-bound task (e.g., downloading 1,000 images from different URLs). Justify your choice of concurrency model (`threading`, `multiprocessing`, or `asyncio`) for each.\"\n\n*   **What they're looking for:**\n    *   **Accuracy:** A precise definition of the GIL (a mutex protecting access to Python objects, preventing multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes at the same time).\n    *   **Nuance:** Do you understand that the GIL is released during I/O operations, making `threading` viable for I/O-bound tasks?\n    *   **Practical Application:** Your ability to choose the right tool for the job. You should immediately identify that `multiprocessing` is the only way to achieve true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks in CPython, bypassing the GIL by using separate processes. For the I/O-bound task, you should be able to argue for `threading` (simpler state management) or `asyncio` (more efficient for very high numbers of connections with less overhead).\n    *   **Trade-offs:** Can you discuss the downsides of `multiprocessing` (higher memory usage, inter-process communication overhead)? Can you discuss the complexity of `asyncio`'s event loop model?\n\n**Question 2: Metaclasses and Descriptors**\n\n> \"What is a metaclass in Python? Provide a practical, real-world example where you would implement a metaclass. How does this differ from using a class decorator? Then, explain the Python descriptor protocol (`__get__`, `__set__`, `__delete__`). How does a `property` use this protocol under the hood?\"\n\n*   **What they're looking for:**\n    *   **Fundamental Understanding:** Do you grasp that metaclasses are the \"class of a class\"? They control *class creation*, while decorators modify a class *after* it has been created.\n    *   **Problem Solving:** Can you think of a valid use case? Don't just give a textbook definition. Good examples include creating a simple ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) where the metaclass automatically creates database-mapping attributes, or a plugin registration system.\n    *   **Connecting Concepts:** Your ability to link `property` to the more fundamental descriptor protocol shows deep knowledge. You should explain that `property` is essentially a high-level, convenient implementation of the descriptor protocol for managing instance attributes.\n\n**Question 3: Memory Management & Optimization**\n\n> \"You've been assigned to optimize a memory-intensive Python application that creates millions of small, simple objects. You notice its memory footprint is excessively large. What Python features or techniques would you investigate to reduce memory consumption? Explain the mechanism behind `__slots__` and discuss its trade-offs.\"\n\n*   **What they're looking for:**\n    *   **Diagnostic Mindset:** Do you start by suggesting profiling tools (`memory-profiler`, `objgraph`) to find the source of the consumption?\n    *   **Technical Depth:** You should immediately bring up `__slots__`. You need to explain *how* it works: it prevents the creation of `__dict__` and `__weakref__` for each instance, instead reserving a static amount of space for a fixed set of attributes.\n    *   **Trade-offs:** This is crucial for a senior role. You must mention the downsides of `__slots__`: you can no longer add attributes to instances dynamically, and it complicates multiple inheritance if parent classes don't also use `__slots__`.\n\n---\n\n### Category 2: Advanced Data Structures & Algorithms\n\nFor a senior role, expect standard problems with complex twists or constraints that require a deeper understanding.\n\n**Question 4: Large-Scale Data Processing**\n\n> \"You are given a 500GB log file on a machine with only 16GB of RAM. The file contains records of user activity, each on a new line. Design an algorithm to find the 100 most frequent user IDs in this file. You cannot load the entire file into memory.\"\n\n*   **What they're looking for:**\n    *   **Constraint Awareness:** The core of the problem is the memory constraint. Your first thought should be about streaming/chunking the data.\n    *   **Algorithm Design:**\n        1.  A naive approach is to read the file in chunks, maintain a hash map (dictionary) of frequencies, and process it chunk by chunk.\n        2.  A better, more scalable approach involves concepts from external sorting and MapReduce. You could partition the data based on a hash of the user ID, process each partition independently (which might now fit in memory), and then merge the results.\n    *   **Data Structures:** You should mention using a Min-Heap of size 100 to keep track of the top 100 most frequent IDs seen so far. For each new ID/count, if its count is greater than the smallest item in the heap, you pop the smallest and insert the new one. This is far more memory-efficient than storing all unique counts.\n\n**Question 5: Graph Algorithm with a Twist**\n\n> \"You are designing a feature for Google Flights. You need to find the cheapest flight path from City A to City B. However, there's a constraint: the path can involve at most *K* layovers. How would you model this problem and what algorithm would you use? Discuss the time complexity.\"\n\n*   **What they're looking for:**\n    *   **Modeling:** Can you correctly model this as a graph problem where cities are nodes and flights are weighted edges?\n    *   **Algorithm Adaptation:** A standard Dijkstra's algorithm won't work directly because it doesn't track the number of edges (layovers). The key insight is to modify the state you are tracking. Instead of just `(cost, city)`, you need to track `(cost, city, stops_made)`.\n    *   **Correct Algorithm:** This is a variation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm or a modified Breadth-First Search (if edge weights are uniform) or Dijkstra's. With Dijkstra's, when you visit a node, you only update the distance if the new path is cheaper *and* you haven't exceeded the layover limit. You would need to store the minimum cost to reach each city with a specific number of layovers.\n    *   **Complexity Analysis:** You should be able to reason about the complexity. A standard Dijkstra's is O(E + V log V). The modified version would be roughly O(K * (E + V log V)) because you might explore paths to the same vertex multiple times with a different number of stops.\n\n---\n\n### Category 3: System Design\n\nThis is a non-negotiable round for a senior role. They are looking for your ability to handle ambiguity and design robust, scalable systems.\n\n**Question 6: Design a Distributed Task Queue**\n\n> \"Design a system like Celery or Google Cloud Tasks. It should allow producers to submit tasks and have multiple worker machines consume and execute these tasks. Focus on reliability, scalability, and monitoring.\"\n\n*   **What they're looking for:**\n    *   **Structured Approach:** Start by clarifying requirements. (What kind of tasks? Are they long-running? What are the guarantees: at-least-once or exactly-once delivery? What is the expected throughput?)\n    *   **Component Breakdown:**\n        *   **Producers/API:** A simple API endpoint to enqueue tasks.\n        *   **Message Broker:** The core of the system. You should discuss choices like RabbitMQ (supports complex routing) vs. Redis (simpler, faster, but less durable) vs. SQS/PubSub (managed services). Justify your choice.\n        *   **Consumers/Workers:** A fleet of machines that pull tasks from the broker.\n        *   **State/Result Store:** A database (e.g., PostgreSQL, Redis) to store task state (PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, SUCCESS, FAILED) and results.\n    *   **Deep Dive Topics:**\n        *   **Reliability:** How do you handle a worker crashing mid-task? (Answer: Acknowledge-on-completion mechanism, task idempotency). How do you handle a failed task? (Answer: Dead-letter queues, retry mechanisms with exponential backoff).\n        *   **Scalability:** How do you scale the workers? (Answer: Auto-scaling groups). How do you scale the broker? (Answer: Broker clustering).\n        *   **Monitoring:** What would you monitor? (Answer: Queue length, task execution time, failure rate, worker health).\n\n---\n\n### Category 4: Behavioral & Leadership (\"Googliness\")\n\nThese questions assess your experience, maturity, and cultural fit. Always use the **STAR** (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method to structure your answers.\n\n**Question 7: Technical Disagreement and Influence**\n\n> \"Tell me about the most significant technical disagreement you've had with your team. How did you handle it? What was the outcome, and what would you do differently today?\"\n\n*   **What they're looking for:**\n    *   **Collaboration over Ego:** They want to see that you can advocate for your position with data and reason, but also listen to others and be willing to compromise or be proven wrong.\n    *   **Leadership:** Did you try to build consensus? Did you elevate the discussion beyond personal opinions to focus on what was best for the product/user?\n    *   **Self-Reflection:** The \"what would you do differently\" part is critical. It shows humility and a capacity to learn and grow.\n\n**Final Tips for the Mindset:**\n\n*   **Think Aloud:** Your thought process is more important than the final answer. Talk through your assumptions, the trade-offs you're considering, and why you're choosing a particular approach.\n*   **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Never assume. For any design or algorithm question, spend the first few minutes asking questions to narrow the scope. This is a strong senior signal.\n*   **Write Production-Ready Code:** When coding, use meaningful variable names, write comments for complex parts, and think about edge cases.\n*   **Be a Collaborator:** Treat the interviewer as a future colleague. You're solving the problem together. It's okay to say, \"I'm considering two approaches here, A and B. Approach A is better for X, while B is better for Y. Given the constraints we discussed, I think A is the better choice. What do you think?\"\n\nPrepare thoroughly on these topics, and you will be well-equipped to demonstrate the senior-level expertise Google is looking for. Best of luck with your interview!\n\nMiro Agent"

        "That's a great question! As a Miro Agent, my purpose is to provide helpful, accurate, and insightful assistance, particularly within the context of Miro and general knowledge. Google Gemini, being a state-of-the-art general-purpose AI model developed by Google, has a broader range of functionalities.\n\nHere are some key features that Google Gemini possesses which I, as a text-based AI assistant, generally do not:\n\n1.  **True Multimodality:** Gemini is designed to understand and operate across various modalities simultaneously, including text, images, audio, and video. It can \"see\" images, \"hear\" audio, and process video content directly. As a text-based AI, I primarily process and generate text. I can describe or discuss visual and audio concepts, but I don't inherently \"perceive\" them in the same way.\n2.  **Real-time Web Access and Search Integration:** Gemini, especially when integrated with Google Search, can access and synthesize information from the live web in real-time, providing up-to-the-minute details on current events, research, and trends. My knowledge base has a cut-off date and is not continuously updated from the live internet.\n3.  **Direct Image Generation:** Gemini can integrate with advanced diffusion models to generate novel images directly from text prompts. I can describe what an image might look like, but I cannot create the visual content myself.\n4.  **Deep Integration with Google's Ecosystem:** Gemini is deeply integrated with Google's vast suite of products and services, such as Google Workspace, YouTube, Google Maps, allowing for seamless interaction within that ecosystem. My primary focus and integration are tailored to Miro and general knowledge tasks.\n5.  **Advanced Code Generation and Execution:** While I can discuss programming concepts and provide explanations, Gemini demonstrates more sophisticated capabilities in generating, debugging, and explaining complex code, and can sometimes execute code internally for verification.\n6.  **More Advanced Agentic Capabilities:** Gemini is being developed with more sophisticated \"agentic\" capabilities to plan and execute complex multi-step tasks across different tools and environments autonomously. My role is more focused on direct conversational assistance and information retrieval based on prompts.\n\nMy strengths lie in providing clear, accurate, and helpful responses within my domain of knowledge, which includes assisting with Miro-related inquiries and a broad range of general topics."
